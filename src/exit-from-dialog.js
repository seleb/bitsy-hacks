@description
Lets you exit to another room from dialog (including inside conditionals).

Note: Bitsy has a built-in implementation of exit-from-dialog as of 7.0;
before using this, you may want to check if it fulfills your needs.

Use it to make an invisible sprite that acts as a conditional exit, use it to warp
somewhere after a conversation, use it to put a guard at your gate who only
lets you in once you're disguised, use it to require payment before the
ferryman will take you across the river.

Using the (exit) function in any part of a series of dialog will make the
game exit to the new room after the dialog is finished. Using (exitNow) will
immediately warp to the new room, but the current dialog will continue.

Usage:
	(exit "<room name>,<x>,<y>,<transition_effect>")
	(exitNow "<room name>,<x>,<y>,<transition_effect>")

Parameter notes:
	- Every paramater is optional
	- If you omit the room, it will use the current room
	- If you omit the x or y, it will use the current position
	- x and y can be written as relative coordinates (e.g. +3, -4, +0)
	- available transitions at time of writing: fade_w, fade_b, wave, tunnel, slide_u, slide_d, slide_l, slide_r

Examples:
	(exit "FinalRoom,8,4")
	(exit "FinalRoom,8,4,tunnel")
	(exit "FinalRoom")
	(exit "FinalRoom,+0,+0,tunnel")
	(exit ",+1,+1")

HOW TO USE:
1. Copy-paste this script into a new script tag after the Bitsy source code.
   It should appear *before* any other mods that handle loading your game
   data so it executes *after* them (last-in first-out).

NOTE:
This uses parentheses "()" instead of curly braces "{}" around function
calls because the Bitsy editor's fancy dialog window strips unrecognized
curly-brace functions from dialog text. To keep from losing data, write
these function calls with parentheses like the examples above.
