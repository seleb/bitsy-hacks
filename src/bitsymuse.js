A hack that adds a variety of audio controls, including music that changes as you move between rooms.
If the same song is played as you move between rooms, the audio file will continue playing.

HOW TO USE:
1. Place your audio files somewhere relative to your bitsy html file (in the zip if you're uploading to itch.io)
2. Copy-paste `<audio id="sound ID" src="relative path to sound file"></audio>` into the <head> of your document.
   You need to do it once for each sound file you are adding, and each needs a unique sound ID. Add `loop` after the `src=""`
   tag if it's music that's going to loop (e.g. `<audio id="sound ID" src="./mySong.mp3" loop></audio>`)
3. Copy-paste this script into a script tag after the bitsy source.
4. Edit hackOptions below to set up the TRACK LIST for rooms you move through.

In addition to the track list, which will play audio based on the room number/name,
you have access to the following commands you can add to dialogue:

1. (soundeffectNow "<sound ID>") will play a sound without interrupting the music as soon as it is called in the dialogue
2. (soundeffect "<sound ID>") will play a sound without interrupting the music once the dialogue box closes
3. (musicNow "<sound ID>") will change the music as soon as it is called in the dialogue
4. (music "<sound ID>") will change the music once the dialogue box closes

You can call both musicNow and music in the same dialogue, to e.g. change the music while you speak to a character
and then restart the regular room music once you stop speaking to them.
You can also use a special ID ("S" by default) to Silence the music.

By default, music tracks automatically restart from the beginning if you go back to a previous track.
This can also be changed in the hackOptions below.
