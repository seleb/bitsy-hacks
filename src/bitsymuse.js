A hack that a variety of audio controls, including music that changes as you move between rooms.
If the same song is played as you move between rooms, the audio file will continue playing.

HOW TO USE:
1. Place your audio files somewhere relative to your bitsy html file (in the zip if you're uploading to itch.io)
2. Copy-paste `<audio id="<sound ID>" src="<relative path to sound file>"></audio>` into the <head> of your document.
   You need to do it once for each sound file you are adding, and each needs a unique sound ID. Add "loop" after the src=""
   tag if it's music that's going to loop (so `<audio id ="<sound id> src="<path>" loop></audio>
3. Copy-paste this script into a script tag after the bitsy source.
4. Edit hackOptions below to set up the TRACK LIST for rooms you move through.

In addition to the track list, which will play audio based on the room number, you have access to the following
commands you can add to dialogue:

1. soundeffect ("<sound ID>") will play a sound without interrupting the music
2. music ("<sound ID>?) will change the music as soon as it is called in the dialogue
3. musicEnd ("<sound ID>") will change the music once the dialogue box closes

You can call both music and musicEnd in the same dialogue, to e.g. change the music while you speak to a character
and then restart the regular room music once you stop speaking to them. "S" can be used as a sound ID for music
and musicEnd to Silence the music.

Whenever music tracks are changed they automatically restart from the beginning if you go back to a previous track.

	//If the player moves between rooms with the same audio ID the music keeps playing seamlessly.
	//Undefined rooms will keep playing whatever music they were last playing
	//You may add a song ID of 'S' to make a room fall silent.
