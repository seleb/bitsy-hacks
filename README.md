## how to use

Each script has a short "HOW TO USE" section included in the comments. For steps which say to `Copy-paste this script into a script tag after the bitsy source `, open your exported bitsy game and scroll to the bottom of the file (at the time of writing, it looks like this):

```html
</script>

</head>


<!-- DOCUMENT BODY -->
<body onload='startExportedGame()'>
  <!-- GAME CANVAS -->
  <canvas id='game'></canvas>
</body>


</html>
```

then edit it to look like this:

```html
</script>

<script>
  // and then paste your code here!
</script>

</head>


<!-- DOCUMENT BODY -->
<body onload='startExportedGame()'>
  <!-- GAME CANVAS -->
  <canvas id='game'></canvas>
</body>


</html>
```
